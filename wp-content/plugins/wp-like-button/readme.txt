== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1: I'd like to place like button of my fanpage, how do I do that? =
Select option "URL to like" and add your fanpage URL. 

= 2: What does green and red circle mean? =
Green means Like button is enabled and red means Like button is disabled.

= 3: What does Each page/post have its own like button mean? =
It means every post and every page will have their own like counts.

= 4: I made the changes but they don't appear? =
Please make sure you save settings after making changes.

= 5: How can I exclude specific pages or post? =
Please select "Exclude following pages and posts", you'd notice a drop down menu. Please type in page or post name, drop down menu would display page or post, please select it through mouse or press enter. 

= 6: I'd like to add like button on footer of my website? =
Copy <?php echo fb_like_button(); ?> from Code Snippet. Then go to the theme editor and paste code in footer.php. 

= 7: I'd like to display like button inside page or post content. =
Please insert short code [fblike] in your page or post content. 

= 8: Why are people seeing a 'Confirm' button when they click on my Like button? =
There are integrity and spam-prevention safeguards built into social plugins, and this is one of them. If you have been heavily testing a Like button before launching, you may have inadvertently triggered these safeguards. Additionally certain domains on the internet are more likely to contain spam, so will see the confirm step more often.

This confirmation adds one extra step to the Like button process, but once the like has been confirmed separately by a number of users, it will no longer appear, and the regular Like button will only appear.
Should I display the Like button by itself or the Like and Share buttons together?

We recommend that you include both buttons on your website to let people choose the way that they want to share your content
