> The Best WordPress Ad Management Plugin?

[Ad Inserter review](https://www.shoutmeloud.com/ad-inserter-review.html) on ShoutMeLoud

> Both Google and Amazon recommend this plugin for inserting ads, which is a testament to its quality

**Endorsed by Google**

Google lists Ad Inserter plugin as possible solution to place code for AdSense ads into your WordPress site.

Ad Inserter is a perfect plugin to place code for Google AdSense ads at top positions for optimal monetization of your website: ordinary AdSense ads (ad units), AMP ads, Auto ads (page level ads), In-feed ads, in-article ads, responsive ads, AdSense ads that need page-specific header code, etc.

> If you're new to AdSense, one of your first tasks is to connect your site to AdSense. This requires you to copy the code on your AdSense homepage and paste it into the HTML of your page, between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags.

Check [How to insert ad code in your WordPress site](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7527509). Advanced users can enable [AdSense integration](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#integration): import AdSense ads from the plugin settings page - no need to copy codes for AdSense ads from the AdSense admin pages. List ad units, preview AdSense ads and get ad codes where you need them.

**Endorsed by Amazon**

> Native Shopping Ads provide highly relevant and dynamic product recommendations in a stylishly designed and responsive ad unit that can be placed at the end of your content or within your content to create a more compelling visitor experience and shopping opportunity.

Maintaining several plugins (often from different vendors) is not easy. And each plugin is slowing down the speed of your website.

**Speed Up Your WordPress: Replace them all with free Ad Inserter!**

**Quick Start**

To become familiar with the plugin check [Quick Start](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/quick-start) to display ads on your website. Few important steps:

*   Completely **disable AdBlocker!** You don't need it when working with ads! Ad blockers prevent displaying ads and also block all AdSense pages!
*   [Code block](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/code-editing) is any code (for example for Google AdSense ads) that has to be inserted (and displayed) at some position. Each code block can be configured to insert code (or ads) at almost any position supported by Wordpress
*   To rename block click on the name
*   If you are using AdSense ads check available tools and code generator for [AdSense ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads)
*   Paste ad code into the code window or use <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/code-editing" target="_blank">code generator</a> to generate code for banners, AdSense ads or any other HTML advert
*   **Enable and use at least one insertion option** (<a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/automatic-insertion" target="_blank">Automatic insertion</a>, Widget, <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/manual-insertion" target="_blank">Shortcode</a>, PHP function call)
*   **Enable insertion on at least one <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/wordpress-page-types">Wordpress page type</a>** (Posts, Static pages, Homepage, Category pages, Search Pages, Archive pages)
*   For Posts and Static pages **leave default BLANK selection value** after the checkbox unless you really know what are you doing (using individual exceptions)
*   If you don't see inserted blocks or ads, turn on **debugging functions**: Label inserted blocks, Show available positions for automatic insertion (Ad Inserter menu item in the Wordpress admin toolbar on the top of every post/page when you are logged in). Check [Troubleshooting](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting) documentation for details.
*   If you are using <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads" target="_blank">AdSense ads</a> you may get blank (empty) ad blocks - no ads are displayed. This might happen because there is some error in the code (wrong IDs), your Google AdSense account is not fully approved yet, your website was not accepted or your Google AdSense account is banned. In such case you can try other ad networks for contextual ads. Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information.

Few typical settings are described on the <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">Common Settings</a> page. Please make sure you have also read <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/plugin-installation">plugin installation</a> documentation. For more detailed instructions please read <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation" target="_blank">Ad Inserter documentation pages</a>.

**Insert Any Code Anywhere on the Page - Automate Insertion of Ads**

*   Automatic insertion using standard WP hooks (the_content, the_excerpt, loop_start, loop_end, the_post,...)
*   Automatic insertion using custom WP hooks provided by themes (e.g. using <a href="https://genesistutorials.com/visual-hook-guide/" target="_blank">Genesis Theme Framework Hooks</a>)
*   Server-side or client-side (javascript) insertion before or after **any HTML element on page** (using selectors #id, .class)
*   Manual insertion with shortcodes
*   Insertion with widgets
*   Insertion by placing PHP function calls or custom hooks in your theme files

Ad Inserter is **the only WordPress plugin that can insert any code or ads anywhere on the page**. If standard insertions before/after post, content or paragraph can't be used, you can use advanced insertion [before/after arbitrary HTML element](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/automatic-insertion#before-after-html-element).

If you can create a CSS slector for the page element (#id, .class) then you can insert ads before or after that element. By default this approach uses client-side insertion using Javascript to insert code block after the page loads.

However, if you enable Output buffering (tab &#9881; / tab General) you can select also Server-side insertion which will insert code block the same way as other insertions when the plugin is called and the page is created.

Please note that **Output buffering** may not work with all themes - in such case you can still use client-side insertion.

**Please support plugin development**

If you are using Ad Inserter and you like it, then please write about it and spread the word on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ad-inserter/reviews/">review page</a>.

Positive reviews are a great way to show your appreciation for my work. Besides being an incredible boost to my morale, they are also a great incentive to fix any bug found in the software and to add new features for better monetization of your website.

1. Go to Ad Inserter general settings (tab &#9881;) and click on Reset All Settings
1. Go to Ad Inserter general settings (tab &#9881;) and click on Clear All Statistics Data (Pro only)
2. Deactivate Ad Inserter
3. Delete Ad Inserter plugin

*Please Note*

Ad Inserter inserts only the code you configure (blocks 1 - 16, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
When you deactivate Ad Inserter it can't insert anything as WordPress doesn't call it. If you still see ads please clear all the caches and check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure code block with some javacript ad code, then this code may generate ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use Ad Inserter to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check Ad Inserter code blocks or ads is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)

When you deactivate Ad Inserter it can't insert anything - WordPress doesn't call it. If you still see some ads that were inserted by Ad Inserter, make sure you have cleared all the caches.
If you still see those ads after you have disabled Ad Inserter and cleared all the caches, then the ads were not inserted by Ad Inserter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated Ad Inserter. How can I use it? =

1. After activation, click "Settings / Ad Inserter" to access the settings page
2. There are 16 code blocks - each block means ad code at some position (or multiple positions in some cases)
3. Put ad (or any other HTML/Javascript/PHP) code into the code window
4. Set automatic insertion option (for example: Before Post)
5. Enable at least one page type (for example: Posts, some insertion options don't work on all page types)
6. Save settings
7. Check also <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common Ad Inserter settings</a>
8. Check inserted code on the posts
9. Ads are not showing? Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a> to find out what to check to fix the problem.


= Does Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =

No revenue sharing and no such thing as "internal ads" or "our ads" on your website. Period. What you configure is what will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
Ad Inserter is free, open source plugin and inserts only the code you configure (blocks 1 - 16, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted. Please check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure code block with some javacript ad code, then this code may generate ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use Ad Inserter to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check Ad Inserter code blocks is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)


= I have installed code for AdSense ads and I see ads placed at random positions. =

You are probably using code for [AdSense Auto ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads).

AdSense Auto ads (known also as Page Level Ads) is a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display AdSense ads on positions chosen by the code.
Auto ads use Google's machine learning to pick the best placements on your pages to show ads. You only need to add one piece of code to all your pages, and let Google take care of the rest.

Auto ads may not be suitable for some WordPress themes or layouts. In such cases it is easier to place ads at wanted locations by using [normal AdSense code](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ad-unit) and specifying exact locations where the code should be inserted.

= I have installed code for AdSense ads but the ad blocks are blank. =

Blank AdSense ad block means that the code is inserted properly only the ad code doesn't display ads. Typical reasons for this are the following:

*   After the ad code is inserted Google needs some time (hours) to check the pages before it starts to serve ads.
*   AdSense account is not fully approved yet - if your account is new you need to wait until Google checks ad codes on your website and and confirms your account. Usually this takes few days.
*   Your website or page is not approved yet - you need to wait until Google web crawlers check your pages.
*   Your website or page was not approved for AdSense ads
*   Your AdSense account is banned
*   No ads available for your website
*   Errors in ad code - check or regenerate ad code
*   You are using ad blocker

In such case you can try other ad networks for contextual ads. Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information.

= What is GDPR? =

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) that was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. If you collect personal information from any EU citizen (within or outside the EU), you must first obtain explicit and unambiguous consent.

= GDPR compliance: What cookies does the plugin use =

Ad Inserter itself does not use cookies except for ad blocking detection when you use delayed action.

In this case 3 cookies may be used (to store pageviews and action settings): `aiADB`, `aiADB_PV` and `aiADB_PR`. However, no personal data is stored in the cookies.

Of course, the ads you may insert with the plugin may use own cookies - please check with ad networks for details.

= How to display a GDPR compliant cookie message? =

You can use any plugin for GDPR compliance / cookie consent. For example:

*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)

PLEASE NOTE: Installing GDPR plugin alone does not make your site GDPR compliant. Since ads you insert may use various cookies, you may need to make sure you have necessary configurations in place. Please check next question regarding showing ads based on visitor's consent.

= How to show ads based on visitor's consent? =

Ad Inserter supports inserting (showing) ads based on cookies or cookie values. You can define cookie conditions by black/white-listing *Url parameters* (where also [cookies are checked](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/black-and-white-lists#cookies)).

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using caching (very likely) you also need to set **Dynamic blocks** to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General) in order to check cookies in visitor's browser and not when the page is generated.

For example, If you are using one of the following plugins for cookie consent you need to **white-list the following cookie and value in Url parameter list**:

*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/) - White-list `viewed_cookie_policy=yes`
*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/) - White-list `cookie_notice_accepted=true`
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/) - White-list `catAccCookies=1`

= Settings for widget ads =

*   Nothing needed, just enter the code for ads and save settings - widget is enabled by default
*   Go to Appearance / Widgets, drag Ad Inserter widget to the sidebar or any other widget position, select block and click on Save (button Save might be disabled until you make some change)
*   Optionally you can enable Sticky widget - this means that this widget (and widgets below) will stay fixed in the sidebar when the page is scrolled - Sticky sidebar or Fixed widget feature
*   You can also make other widgets sticky even if you don't use Ad Inserter ads - drag Ad Inserter widget to the sidebar ABOVE the top widget that needs to be sticky, select Dummy Widget for Block, check Sticky and save widget
*   In general plugin settings (tab &#9881;) you can also define Sticky Widget Top Margin to precisely define top position where the first sticky widget will stick

Additional note regarding *Sticky Widgets* - *Sticky Sidebars*:

There are two modes for sticky widgets (or sticky sidebars) available as **Sticky widget mode** in general plugin settings (tab &#9881;):

*   CSS mode - This mode is the best approach but may not work with all themes. CSS mode works by changing sidebar CSS to `position: sticky`. This works with most themes but not all. If your widgets and sidebar aren't sticking as expected you can use **JavaScript mode** described below.
*   JavaScript mode - This mode should work with practically all themes but may reload ads on page load when sticky sidebar is initialized.


= Settings for contextual Amazon Native Shopping Ads =

*   Automatic Insertion: After Content
*   On all Posts checked, other page types unchecked

Sign in to Amazon Associates, go to Widgets/Widget Source, choose ad type and set parameters.
For titles and search terms use tags. For example, the code below would display amazon products related to the post tags - check documentation for all possible tags.

`<script type="text/javascript">
amzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0";
amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true";
amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "ad-inserter-20";
amzn_assoc_search_bar_position = "top";
amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "search";
amzn_assoc_ad_type = "smart";
amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";
amzn_assoc_region = "US";
amzn_assoc_title = "Search Results from Amazon";
amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = "[adinserter data='smart-tag']";
amzn_assoc_default_category = "All";
amzn_assoc_linkid = "cf1873f027a57f63cede634cfd444bea";
</script>
<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>`

Use your own tracking id! Please note `[adinserter data='smart-tag']` as default search phrase. This makes this widget contextual. It will show products related to the tags for this post.

You can also use <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields" target="_blank">custom fields</a> to make the widget contextual. For example, if you define in posts custom field named `amazon-keyword` you can use `[adinserter custom-field='amazon-keyword']' for `amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase` variable.

You can also try with `[adinserter data='tag']', `[adinserter data='short-title']`, `[adinserter data='category']` or `[adinserter data='short-category']`. For more options check <a href="http://adinserter.pro/documentation#code-block-options" target="_blank">Ad Inserter documentation page</a>.


= Settings for ads ... =

Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common Ad Inserter settings</a>


= What PHP versions are supported? =

Officially PHP 5.6 and higher versions up to PHP 7.2 are supported. However, Ad Inserter should work also with older PHP versions supported by WordPress.
Some plugins like PHP Compatibility Checker may report warnings with PHP 7.2 because they check also files that are loaded only for older PHP versions.


= I wish to show ads side by side but not in the same block. How do I do this? =

Configure block 1 and 2 with ads using:

*   Automatic Insertion: Disabled
*   Block Alignment and Style: No Wrapping
*   Enable shortcode: checked

Configure block 3 with

`[adinserter block="1"]
[adinserter block="2"]`

Use block 3 to insert ads and make sure all 3 blocks are enabled for the same page types (Posts, Pages, Homepage, etc.).


= I use After Content insertion position but the ads are inserted after the stuff provided by other plugins. How can I insert ads directly after post content?

This happens because Ad Inserter processes posts last and therefore "sees" also content added by other plugins.

Try to set Ad Inserter plugin priority to 10 (early processing, Ad Inserter settings - tab &#9881; / tab General).


= How can I add some title or label (e.g. Advertisements) above the ads? =

If this is a sidebar widget then you can simply name the widget.

For each code block you can also show a label above each ad. Default text (or HTML code) for ad labels can be set on the general plugin settings tab (tab &#9881; / tab General / **Ad label**.
To enable ad label above the ad go to code block for this ad, click on the Misc button and then on the Display tab check **Ad label**.

If you configured only text for ad label then the following code will be added above ad code: `<div class="code-block-label">AD_LABEL_TEXT</div>` (`code-block` is the block class name used, AD_LABEL_TEXT is the text for Ad Label).
You can then style the label using CSS for class `.code-block-label` (the best place for this code is Header section). If HTML code is configured for ad label then this code will be used (instead of the div code above).

In case you need a different label for some ad you can simply add label HTML code above the ad code. For example:

`<h3>Advertisements</h3>

AD_CODE`


= How can I enable/disable ads on specific posts/pages? =

There are two possible approaches.

*   Approach with page/post exceptions - use this one if there are many exceptions (more than two):

1. Go to Ad Inserter settings page and define default insertion options for post/page.
2. Enable automatic insertion on posts/pages and choose default insertion: **Individually disabled** or **Individually enabled**.
3. Save settings.
4. Go to post/page editor and open **Ad Inserter Individual Exceptions** meta box below.
5. define insertion exceptions for this post or page.
6. Save post/page.

**Individually disabled** means that insertion will be by default enabled on all posts (according to the settings for this code block), but you will be able to disable insertion on individual posts or pages (in post/page editor).

**Individually enabled** means that insertion will be by default disabled on all posts, but you will be able to enable insertion on individual posts or pages (in post/page editor) - of course, other settings (e.g. lists) for this code block will also apply.

*   Approach with code block settings only - use this one if there are only few exceptions:

1. Go to Ad Inserter settings page and define default insertion options for post/page.
2. Enable automatic insertion for Posts/Pages (use default value after checkbox - blank selection means no individual exceptions).
3a. Click on Lists, enter post IDs (click on the button left of the list) and white-list or black-list them.
3b. Click on Lists, enter url (or comma separated urls) for Urls, e.g. `/permalink-url`, and white-list or black-list it.

For details check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/individual-post-and-page-exceptions" target="_blank">Individual Post/Page Exceptions</a>.


= I'm using responsive theme. How can I show or hide some ads on mobile devices? =

Select device types (desktop, tablet or phone) for which you need to show ads and enable **only client-side** device detection.


= How can I enable or disable ads on group of similar pages? =

If those pages have something in common in the url (page address) then you can block them with url patterns.
Use `*` to define url pattern to whitelist (enable) or blacklist (disable).

1. To filter all urls starting with **/url-start** use `/url-start*`
2. To filter all urls that contain **url-pattern** use `*url-pattern*`
3. To filter all urls ending with **url-end** use `*url-end`

For example, to exclude ads on pages that have /shop/ in url (page address) blacklist the following url: `*/shop/*`


= How can I put ads in the middle of the post regardless of the number of paragraphs? =

Use Before paragraph automatic insertion and put 0.5 as paragraph number. Value between 0 and 1 means relative position in post or page (e.g. 0.3 means paragraph 30% from top or bottom)


= How can I put ads before the second paragraph and also in the middle of post with single ad block? =

Use Before paragraph automatic insertion and put `2, 0.5` as paragraph number. You can specify multiple paragraphs as comma separated paragraph numbers (or relative postions).


= I'd like to rotate my ads based on percentage, for example show one ad 75% of the time and another one 25% of the time. Is that possible? =

Yes. Either use rotation code generator and define shares in percents or create code using `ROTATE` separator with attribute *share* where you define percentage of the rotation share:

`[ADINSERTER ROTATE share="75"]
ad_code_1
[ADINSERTER ROTATE share="25"]
ad_code_2`

If you omit one share value it will be automatically calculated:

`ad_code_1
[ADINSERTER ROTATE share="25"]
ad_code_2`


= How can I show different ads to different visitors according to a url query parameter? =

Use Url parameters List to black/white-list certain url parameters. Leave url parameter list empty and set it to Black list to show ads for all url.
You can specify either parameters or parameters with values. For example for url `http://example.com?data=2&customer-id=22&device=0` you can define url parameters '`data, customer-id=22`' to insert ad only for urls where there is `data` parameter and `customer-id` parameter with value 22.
Separate parameters with comma.


= How can I use PHP code for code block? =

Enter PHP code surrounded by PHP tags and check Process PHP.
Example:

`<div style="width: 100%;">
Some HTML/Javascript code
</div>
<?php echo "PHP code by Ad Inserter"; ?>`


= How can I rotate few versions of the same ad? =

Enter them into the ad box and separate them with `[ADINSERTER ROTATE]`. Ad Inserter will insert them randomly.
Example:

`ad_code_1
[ADINSERTER ROTATE]
ad_code_2
[ADINSERTER ROTATE]
ad_code_3`


= What settings should I use for ads on AMP pages? =

Normally the code will not be inserted on AMP pages. There are two settings that can be used to insert code on AMP pages:

1. **AMP pages** checkbox in **Misc / Insertion** section - If checked it enables insertion also on AMP pages. **Use this approach only if you need to insert the same code on normal and AMP pages.** To insert different codes on AMP pages use **[ADINSERTER AMP]** separator as described below.
2. Separate the codes with **[ADINSERTER AMP]** separator - the code above the separator will be inserted on normal pages, the code below the separator will be inserted on AMP pages. This separator can be used also for **Header** and **Footer** code.

The following AMP plugins have been tested with Ad Inserter:
*   <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/" target="_blank">AMP for WP - Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> (free)
*   <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">AMP</a> (free)
*   <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-amp-ninja/" target="_blank">WP AMP Ninja</a> (free)
*   WP AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages for WordPress (paid - you need to uncheck *Remove third-party the_content hooks for better compatibility*)

For details check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/amp-pages" target="_blank">settings for ads on AMP pages</a>.


= How can place ads below Read More tag? =

Configure ad block with the following options:

*   Automatic Insertion: After Paragraph
*   Paragraph Number: 1
*   Count only paragraphs that CONTAIN: `<span id="more-`

Check source code of your website for proper "read more" tag.


= How can I insert ads or code block directly into template php file? =

Enable PHP function adinserter for code block and call adinserter function with code block number as parameter.
Example for block 3:

`<?php if (function_exists ('adinserter')) echo adinserter (3); ?>`

This would generate code as defined for the code block number 3. Before you modifu theme files it makes sense to create a <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">child theme</a> first.


= Center alignment does not work for some ads! =

Some ads can not be centered using the standard approach so some different CSS code is needed to put them in the middle.

In Preview window you can try alternative CSS code for centering the ad. Double-click on the icon for Center alignment and the code will toggle. The current code version is displayed next to Alignment and Style selection.


= How can I rotate between different alignments so I can test an ad aligned to the right against an ad aligned to the left? =

Set Block Alignment and Style to "No Wrapping" and create manual wrapping around both ads separated with [ADINSERTER ROTATE]:

`<div style="float: left; margin: 0 8px 8px 0;">
AD CODE LEFT
</div>

[ADINSERTER ROTATE]

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 8px 8px;">
AD CODE RIGHT
</div>`
